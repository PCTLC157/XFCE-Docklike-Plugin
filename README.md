# XFCE-Docklike-Plugin
This procedure may not be necessary in the future if this Docklike Plugin Taskbar is added as a default option by the XFCE team.
I created this script to help a fellow Linux community member who was having trouble installing this plugin.
Please keep in mind I have tested this in Peppermint based on Debian 11 without issues as of 23rd April 2022, I suggest testing this script in a virtual environment first as I cannot guarantee it will not create issues on your Linux install.
This script will download and compile with the necessary dependencies and install the XFCE Docklike Plugin Taskbar.
This has been tested with Peppermint which is now based on Debian 11, so I suppose it should work on a Debian 11 XFCE desktop environment, I have not tested this.
I have not tested this on any Ubuntu based XFCE desktops.
To Install
Navigate to the folder where the xfce4-docklike-plugin.sh file is,
Right click anywhere within the file manager and open in terminal,
type the following
./xfce4-docklike-plugin.sh
